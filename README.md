# Project description
The scope of the project is to analyze the correlations among Fear and Greed Index, Bitcoin Price, and the S&P Cryptocurrency Broad Digital Asset (BDA) Index. In particular, The Fear and Greed Index measures crypto market sentiment. The BDA Index is the cryptocurrency market benchmark index. This benchmark index is designed to track the performance of a wide range of investable digital assets that meet specific liquidity and market capitalization criteria. 

# Data sources
For the timeframe, I chose the historical data timeframe to be from 05/02/2024 to 11/06/2025. The number of rows is 554, which corresponds to 554 days, around one and a half years. 
All three datasets are within this timeframe. 
The Fear and Greed Index and the Bitcoin Price historical data are both obtained through writing python code and calling API. The BDA Index is obtained from the S&P Global website.
